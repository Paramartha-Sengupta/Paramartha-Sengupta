## 👋 About Me

Hi there, I'm **Paramartha Sengupta**!

- 🔬 **Data & Applied Scientist II** at **Microsoft** — working within the OneNote & Copilot Notebooks ecosystem
- 💼 ~6 years of experience in **Analytics & Data Science**
- 🎓 **B.Tech** — National Institute of Technology, Durgapur (2019)
- 🎓 **M.Tech in AI & Machine Learning** — BITS Pilani (2025)
- 🌟 **Data Science Mentor** — KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Programme (Dec 2022 – Mar 2023)

## 📌 What I Do

### Product Analytics & Growth
- **Product Analytics & PLG Growth** — Defining north-star metrics, HEART+ aligned scorecards, and application-level views to track adoption, engagement, and retention.
- **Experiment Design & Causal Measurement** — Framing hypotheses, running metric validations, and quantifying retention lift and WAU impact from feature rollouts and onboarding changes.
- **Forecasting & Scenario Modeling** — Building weekly WAU/retention projections and initiative-level what-if models for MBR planning.
- **Behavioral & Journey Analytics** — Funnel diagnostics, sequence analysis, and cohort cuts to find drop-offs and habit drivers.

### Metrics, Telemetry & Data Infrastructure
- **Metric Taxonomy & KPI Definitions** — Authoring precise event/metric specs (including Copilot-specific actions) to create a single source of truth across Engineering and PM.
- **Telemetry & Data Pipelines** — Partnering on event instrumentation, licensing/eligibility logic, and metric publishing from raw streams to production dashboards.

### AI & Machine Learning Applications
- **LLM/AI Applications in Product** — Intent detection from chat, RAG-style solutions, and meeting-intelligence PoCs to unlock agentic experiences.
- **Research & Experimentation** — Exploring cutting-edge techniques in AI, NLP, and productivity tools.

### Communication & Leadership
- **Dashboards & Executive Storytelling** — Power BI scorecards and MBR/SLT decks that translate telemetry into crisp, decision-oriented narratives.
- **Stakeholder Leadership & Cross-Team Alignment** — Working with PMs, Engineering, and Leadership to prioritize, spec, and operationalize growth workstreams.
- **Mentoring & Team Enablement** — Defining DS charters, growing the function, and enabling vendor/FTE scale with clear plans and artifacts.
