# Portfolio & Projects

Welcome to my GitHub space! Here you'll find projects, research, and contributions spanning data science, applied AI, and productivity innovation.
- 👋 Hi Viewer, I’m Paramartha
- 👜 I'm having about ~6 years of experience in the Analytics and Data Science domain.
- I have also acted as a Data Science Mentor for KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship programme from Dec'2022 to Mar'2023.
- 📚 Completed my Bachelors degree from National Institue of Technology, Durgapur (2019), and my Masters in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning from BITS Pilani (2025)

## 📌 Overview

As a **Data and Applied Scientist II** at Microsoft, I focus on:
- Building data-driven solutions at scale
- Applying machine learning to solve real-world problems
- Contributing to the OneNote and Copilot Notebooks ecosystem
-     **Product analytics & PLG growth** — defining north‑star metrics, HEART+ aligned scorecards, and application‑level views to track adoption, engagement, and retention.
-     **Experiment design & causal measurement** — framing hypotheses, running metric validations, and quantifying retention lift and WAU impact from feature rollouts and onboarding changes.
-     **Forecasting & scenario modeling** — building weekly WAU/retention projections and initiative‑level what‑if models for MBR planning.
-     **Behavioral & journey analytics** — funnel diagnostics, sequence analysis, and cohort cuts to find drop‑offs and habit drivers.
-     **Metric taxonomy & KPI definitions** — authoring precise event/metric specs (including Copilot‑specific actions) to create a single source of truth across engineering and PM.
-     **LLM/AI applications in product** — intent detection from chat, RAG‑style solutions, and meeting‑intelligence PoCs to unlock agentic experiences.
-     **Dashboards & executive storytelling** — Power BI scorecards and MBR/SLT decks that translate telemetry into crisp, decision‑oriented narratives.
-     **Telemetry & data pipelines** — partnering on event instrumentation, licensing/eligibility logic, and metric publishing from raw streams to production dashboards.
-     **Stakeholder leadership & x‑team alignment** — working with PMs/Eng/LT to prioritize, spec, and operationalize growth workstreams.
-     **Mentoring & team enablement** — defining DS charters, growing the function, and enabling vendor/FTE scale with clear plans and artifacts
- Research and experimentation in AI and productivity tools
